# Design Pattern
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Classification of patterns

- **Creational** patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. 
- **Structural** patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient. 
- **Behavioral** patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
