# Design Pattern

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made
blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Creational Design Pattern

> patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
>  - [Factory Method](Creational/FactoryMethod/README.md)
>  - [Abstract Factory](Creational/AbstractFactory/README.md)
>  - [Builder](Creational/Builder/README.md)
>  - [Prototype](Creational/Prototype/README.md)
>  - [Singleton](Creational/Singleton/README.md)

## Structural Design Pattern

> patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and
> efficient.
>  - [Adapter](Structural/Adapter/README.md)

## Behavioral Design Pattern

> patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. [
>  - [nothing](Behavioral/README.md)
